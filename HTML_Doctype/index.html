<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- 
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration is used at the very beginning of an HTML document. It tells the web browser which version of HTML the page is written in, ensuring that the browser renders the page correctly. In modern web development, <!DOCTYPE html> is used for HTML5, which is the current standard. This declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the browser and must appear before any other HTML code in the document. Using the correct doctype helps avoid rendering issues and ensures your web pages are displayed consistently across different browsers.
